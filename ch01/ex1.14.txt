'while' loop only include the condition in the parentheses.
'for' loop could initialize variables in first loop and change variables in every loop in the parentheses.

if i need a variable to be initialized in first loop, i'd like to use 'for' loop.
if i need a variable to be change in every loop, i'd like to use 'for' loop.
